ok for v2 creating multiple playlists per user could be done by refering to the ownership of the playlist from the playlist side instead of the user side. IE the playlist being assigned to the user rather than the user being assigned to the playlist. For the like account staus we could just create a nother column in the user table call it something like "account_type" then just have something that sets the value per person and we can at any time sort that user data base by account type.
